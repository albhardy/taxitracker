###How to Run the app

* npm install
* npm start

This is a Forked Repo for [NYC Taxis: A Day in the Life](http://nyctaxi.herokuapp.com), a data visualization that shows the movements and earnings of a single NYC taxi over 24 hours created by Chris Whong. I rewrite the backend animation using keyframe approach instead of iterative animation. This improves animation accuracy as well as allows parallel animation. Do note that I use static json as data source.
